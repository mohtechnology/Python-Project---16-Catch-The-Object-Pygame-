# Python Project - 16 "Catch The Object Pygame"

In this video, I walk you through creating a fun and simple "Catch the Object" game using Python and Pygame. This project is a great introduction to game development and Pygame's key features.

In this tutorial, we will:
- Set up the game window and player properties.
  ```python
  pip install pygame
  ```
- Create falling objects with random positions.
- Implement controls for the player to catch the objects.
- Track score and attempts, with game-over conditions.
- Use basic collision detection to update the game state.
